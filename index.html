    <h1>Cells</h1>
    <!-- my Analogy of the Cell -->
     <div class="Computer">
      <h2>The Cell is like a Computer</h2>
      <div class="Mitochondria">
        <h3>Mitochondria vs PSU(Power Supply)</h3>
        <p>Mitochondria is a powerhouse of the cell. It is the powerhouse of the cell because it produces our energy with the process called cellular respiration and, in a way, PSU is like the Mitochondria but for the computer since PSU's job is to convert the AC coming from the wall into the DC that our computers can use.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Nucleus">
        <h3>Nucleus vs CPU(Central Processing Unit)</h3>
        <p>The Nucleus is like the control centre of the cell telling everthing, what to do. The CPU controls everything and gives instructions to everthing too.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Endoplasmic Reticulum">
        <h3>ER(Endoplasmic Reticulum) vs Wires/Traces</h3>
        <p>The ER handles the movement/transportations of nutrients and waste whitin the cell. Meanwhile wires and traces handle the movement/transportation of power and data within the computer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Cytoplasm">
        <h3>Cytoplasm vs Everything inside the Computer</h3>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <div class="Cell Membrane">
        <h3>Cell Membrane vs Case</h3>
        <p>The Cell membrane controlls what goes in and out of the cell and the case kinda protects the computer in a way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Vacuole">
        <h3>Vacuole vs Storage(HDD/SSD)</h3>
        <p>The Vacuole stores nutrients and an the SSD/HDD stores data so like the SSD/HDD is like a Vacuole for the Computer</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Ribosomes">
        <h3>Ribosomes vs Printer</h3>
        <p>Ribosomes produce proteins and Printers print documents.</p>
